# Spiking Neural Network in PyTorch
Implementation of Spiking Neural Network in PyTorch

- **SpikingConv2D** : Spiking Convolutional Layer
- **SpikingLinear** : Spiking Fully Connected Layer

### Data-Based Normalization
This repository, also contains an implementation of the data-based algroithm proposed in paper available at: [Fast-Classifying, High-Accuracy Spiking Deep Networks Through Weight and Threshold Balancing](https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280696).
